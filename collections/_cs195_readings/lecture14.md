<b>Abstract:</b> We all want the future to be better than the present,
and many of us would like to be a part of making that happen. However, sometimes
in our attempts to build that better future we lose sight of who that future is
for and what is being lost with the changes we so quickly usher in. Embedded in
our projects to program the cities of the future, “smart” cities, are
technologies that have deep implications for wealth and its distribution, as
well as power and its concentration. In this lecture, we’ll discuss some of the
values that are built into smart cities through the application of machine
learning technologies, and consider for whom we are building these cities.
Building more inclusive, democratic cities will require us to recenter our work
around socio-political, not technical, questions. Such an undertaking will pose
epistemological challenges to the engineering status-quo. Moreover, it will
require us to face institutional and personal challenges as well, as we will
have to confront our own positions of power and privilege in society. This
process, however, is essential if we are serious about contributing to a more
just, equitable future.
