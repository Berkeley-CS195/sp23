Readings:

- Cathy O'Neil, Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil, Ch. 1, 4, and 5
  - You can fill out a single reading note, but please address each chapter separately in the Précis box.
  - This one is a bit tricky to link to directly, sorry:
    - Go to <https://www.ebsco.com/find-my-organization>, and search for "UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY".
    - Log in, and go to the EBSCOhost Web resource.
    - Select all databases (we really just need the eBookCollection but this is easier), and continue.
    - Search for “Weapons of Math Destruction”, and click on “EPUB Full Text”.
    - (This link might work; no guarantees and I would not be surprised if it didn’t. <https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzExMDk5NDBfX0FO0?sid=ad6346>)
